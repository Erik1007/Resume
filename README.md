## Introduction

This is meant to be a beginning example of who I am and a little of what I can do. Ive been studying the ways of a full stack developer for a little more than a year. However, I have really found a calling with predictive analysis, data analysis and A:I: machine learning as it allows me to combine my extensive history in experimental research  (psychology) and data analysis with all the new exciting programming processes.
